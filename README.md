# Unit Testing With XCTest
This IOS app demonstrates unit tests and user interface tests using Xcode's built-in testing framework.

We are going to answer the questions like by unit testing:
- Are the words loaded correctly?
- Are the word counts correct?
- Did the words get counted in an appropriate time?
- Does our user filtering work?
- when the view controller loads, does it show the correct number of words?

## Main Targets
Unit Testing, User interface testing, XCTest, filter

## Credits
The concept of this app is adapted from Hacking with Swift book written by Paul Hudson.
